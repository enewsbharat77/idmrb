                        The <strong>Publisher Revenue & Sustainability Committee</strong> is
                        IDMRB’s dedicated forum for fortifying the financial resilience of
                        digital news publishers. The Committee brings together senior
                        business leaders, editorial strategists and policy experts to design
                        practical monetization pathways that preserve editorial independence
                        while ensuring long-term commercial viability. Through
                        evidence-based dialogue and industry-wide collaboration, the
                        Committee aims to reduce platform dependency, diversify income
                        streams and create sustainable business models suited to India’s
                        diverse digital ecosystem.
