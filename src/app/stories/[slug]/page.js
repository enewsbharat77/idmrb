    content: `The *IDMRB Digital Media Conclave 2025* brought together digital publishers, OTT platforms, policy experts, and media innovators from across the country to discuss the rapid transformation of India's news and content ecosystem. One of the highlights of the event was a special video address by *Shri Rajeev Chandrasekhar*, former Minister of State for Electronics & Information Technology and Skill Development, who shared his insights on the future of digital media and the responsibilities that come with it.

Although he could not be physically present, Shri Chandrasekhar's message set the tone for the day's discussions. He emphasized that India is witnessing an unprecedented shift from traditional news consumption to digital-first content, especially among younger audiences. This transition, he noted, brings vast opportunities but also necessitates a strong framework of responsibility, transparency, and ethical media practices.

In his message, he highlighted the urgent need for a structured approach to digital news, urging industry leaders to work collectively on strengthening credibility, addressing misinformation, and ensuring that the digital audience receives accurate and verified content. He encouraged publishers to innovate fearlessly while maintaining integrity, adding that the country looks to the media to act as a pillar of accountability in a rapidly changing information landscape.

Speaking about the growing influence of Artificial Intelligence in content creation, Shri Chandrasekhar underlined that the rise of AI must come with safeguards to protect copyright, prevent misuse, and preserve the authenticity of digital journalism. He stressed that while AI-driven innovation is inevitable, mechanisms must be established to prevent manipulation, misinformation, and content dilution. According to him, the future of digital media requires an ecosystem where technology and accountability coexist harmoniously.

The Minister reaffirmed that the Government of India is fully committed to assisting digital publishers and OTT platforms through this transitional phase. He stated that the government's goal is not to restrict digital media but to enable smooth, disruption-free growth by offering policy support, transparency in governance, and collaboration with industry bodies like IDMRB. He expressed confidence that IDMRB's collective insights and discussions would lead to a constructive policy roadmap that would guide India's digital publishing environment in the years ahead.

Concluding his address, Shri Chandrasekhar reiterated the immense responsibility resting on digital media organizations. He emphasized that the nation relies on digital publishers not only for timely information but for responsible, ethical, and balanced reporting. As India stands at the threshold of a digital revolution, he encouraged stakeholders to move forward with openness, vision, and a sense of duty toward the truth.

The *IDMRB Digital Media Conclave 2025* served as an important platform to reflect on the challenges of digital transformation and explore solutions that prioritize ethics, innovation, and national interest. With government support and industry collaboration, the conclave marks a significant step toward building a responsible and future-ready digital media ecosystem for India.`

    image: "/stories/story3.jpg",
    date: "19-11-2025",
    content: `The Indian Digital Media Regulatory Board (IDMRB) is set to introduce a new era of transparency, accountability, and innovation in the country's rapidly expanding digital news and content ecosystem. Speaking about the future roadmap, newly appointed Chairman Mukesh Dadhich shared that IDMRB is ready to implement several transformative measures that will redefine how digital publishers, OTT platforms, and online newsrooms operate in India.

In his vision statement, Mukesh Dadhich emphasized that the digital media sector has evolved faster than any other form of communication in the past decade. With millions of users consuming news through mobile phones, social platforms, and OTT content, he believes the time has come for a strong, independent, and forward-looking regulatory structure that supports both creativity and responsibility. He stated that the role of IDMRB is not to restrict media freedom but to ensure that digital publishers operate within a transparent and ethical framework aligned with India's IT Rules and global digital best practices.

Dadhich highlighted that misinformation, unverified content, AI-generated fake visuals, and unregulated monetization practices are some of the biggest challenges facing digital publishers today. Under his leadership, IDMRB is preparing guidelines that will help platforms maintain credibility while also adapting to technological advancements. These reforms will include improved grievance redressal mechanisms, training programs for digital journalists, and a unified code of conduct to ensure ethical reporting and content authenticity.

One of his key priorities is to bring OTT platforms, independent digital news portals, and emerging creators under a uniform compliance umbrella so that content integrity and consumer trust remain central to the digital ecosystem. Dadhich emphasized that IDMRB will work closely with publishers, tech experts, and government stakeholders to shape policies that allow digital media to grow sustainably without compromising the public's right to accurate information.

    title: "IDMRB: A Self-Regulatory Body Under MIB, Strengthening India's Digital Media Framework",
    image: "/stories/storys4.jpg",
    date: "19-11-2025",
    content: `India's digital ecosystem is expanding at a pace never seen before, with news portals, OTT platforms, and independent digital publishers becoming the primary source of information for millions. In this era of rapid transformation, the Ministry of Information & Broadcasting (MIB) has emphasized the need for responsible, ethical, and transparent digital publishing. In line with this vision, the Indian Digital Media Regulatory Board (IDMRB) has emerged as a structured self-regulatory body committed to guiding India's digital media sector towards credibility and accountability.

IDMRB operates as a self-governing, industry-driven institution aligned with the principles of the IT Rules, 2021, which mandate that digital news publishers and OTT platforms establish or join a recognized self-regulatory framework. By functioning under the broader oversight guidelines laid out by the Ministry of Information & Broadcasting, IDMRB ensures that digital publishers follow ethical standards while still enjoying the creative freedom essential for a thriving digital media environment.

As a self-regulatory body, IDMRB does not impose restrictions but instead provides a transparent, fair, and collaborative structure for digital media entities. Its mission focuses on supporting publishers through compliance guidance, grievance redressal systems, content evaluation standards, and capacity-building initiatives. This ensures that digital media remains free, factual, and accountable—qualities that have become critical in a time where misinformation, manipulated content, and AI-generated fake visuals pose serious challenges.

The Board also acts as a bridge between digital publishers and MIB, helping resolve compliance concerns, clarifying regulatory requirements, and contributing to policy suggestions that reflect both industry needs and national interests. Through its initiatives, IDMRB aims to increase trust among audiences by promoting responsible storytelling and ethical content creation.

With India moving towards a data-driven future, IDMRB stands as a foundational pillar to support publishers in navigating modern challenges such as misinformation, deepfakes, copyright protection, user safety, and AI-integrated news reporting. Under its structured self-regulatory model, the Board ensures that the digital ecosystem evolves with discipline, innovation, and integrity.

In the coming years, IDMRB intends to expand its network, strengthen its internal committees, and develop advanced regulatory tools to help India's digital media industry compete globally. As a self-regulatory body aligned with the Ministry of Information & Broadcasting, IDMRB is committed to building a digital environment that is ethical, future-ready, and rooted in public trust.`

    title: "IDMRB Sets New Benchmarks for Responsible Digital Journalism in India",
    image: "/stories/story5.jpg",
    date: "15-10-25",
    content: `The Indian Digital Media Regulatory Board (IDMRB) is emerging as one of India's most progressive self-regulatory bodies, shaping the future of digital journalism with a renewed focus on ethics, transparency, and accountability. As digital media continues to expand across OTT platforms, news portals, and independent publishers, IDMRB is setting new benchmarks to ensure that the digital information ecosystem remains credible and responsible.

With millions of citizens consuming news on mobile devices and social platforms, the influence of digital media has reached unprecedented levels. This rapid growth, however, has brought with it serious challenges—misinformation, manipulated visuals, AI-based deepfakes, and unverified reporting. Recognizing these concerns, IDMRB has initiated a structured regulatory approach that empowers publishers while safeguarding public interest.

As a recognized self-regulatory institution aligned with the Ministry of Information & Broadcasting (MIB), IDMRB works closely with digital newsrooms to help them adhere to the standards outlined in the IT Rules, 2021. Rather than acting as a restrictive authority, the Board serves as a guiding partner, supporting publishers in building ethical practices, strengthening newsroom governance, and establishing reliable grievance redressal systems.

One of the Board's major goals is to bring greater clarity to the regulatory landscape by simplifying compliance requirements for publishers. IDMRB is also developing sector-specific guidelines that address the unique needs of OTT content creators, online video news broadcasters, and regional digital media networks. By bridging gaps between innovation and integrity, the Board is helping the industry evolve with confidence and discipline.

In addition to compliance support, IDMRB is launching several initiatives aimed at enhancing media literacy, training digital journalists, and creating awareness about responsible content creation. These programs are designed to strengthen public trust at a time when digital misinformation spreads faster than authentic news.

IDMRB's leadership firmly believes that digital freedom thrives best within a framework of responsibility. As India continues to adopt AI-driven content solutions, the Board is working on additional safeguards that will help newsrooms verify sources, protect copyrights, and ensure authenticity before publishing sensitive content.

Through its collaborative approach, IDMRB is building an ecosystem where publishers, creators, government bodies, and audiences can work together to create a transparent and future-ready digital media environment. As the digital revolution reshapes India's communication landscape, IDMRB remains deeply committed to upholding the values of truthful reporting, ethical journalism, and public trust.`

    title: "IDMRB to Open Doors for Rural Digital News Portals and Local OTT Platforms, Empowering Them Through Membership and Innovation Support",
    image: "/stories/storys6.jpg",
    date: "11-11-25",
    content: `In a landmark initiative aimed at strengthening India's grassroots digital media ecosystem, the Indian Digital Media Regulatory Board (IDMRB) has announced that it will soon extend membership opportunities to small-town and rural digital news portals, hyperlocal media platforms, and emerging OTT creators. This move is expected to create a transformative shift for thousands of small digital publishers who operate from villages, tehsils, and district-level regions across the country.

IDMRB believes that the future of digital journalism does not belong only to metros or big media houses—instead, it lies in the hands of local storytellers, regional journalists, and grassroots content creators who bring the voice of real India to the national stage. Many of these platforms work with limited resources, lack access to modern technologies, and remain unaware of policy changes, compliance rules, or emerging innovations. IDMRB aims to bridge this gap by offering them structured guidance, recognition, and a unified community under its self-regulatory framework.

Under this initiative, rural digital publishers and local OTT creators will receive formal membership, granting them access to IDMRB's resource centers, policy updates, training workshops, ethical guidelines, and grievance redressal support. This will not only help them improve content quality and credibility but also prepare them to confidently navigate the complexities of IT Rules 2021, artificial intelligence, copyright challenges, and misinformation control.

According to officials, IDMRB's goal is to ensure that innovation reaches every corner of the country—not just major cities. With AI, digital tools, and modern storytelling evolving rapidly, rural journalists often find themselves left behind. By opening doors to membership, IDMRB aims to help them stay informed about the latest technological trends, newsroom practices, verification tools, and digital ethics. This initiative will also promote a culture of responsible journalism at the local level, where accuracy and trust are essential for community-driven news.

IDMRB understands the challenges faced by small digital portals—financial limitations, lack of training, absence of editorial processes, and minimal exposure to digital policies. With this new membership program, the Board seeks to empower them with knowledge, support systems, and a platform for representation at the national level. This will enable rural publishers to grow professionally, collaborate with larger platforms, and strengthen their identity in India's rapidly expanding digital media landscape.

By democratizing access to regulatory support, IDMRB is setting a powerful example of inclusive growth. The Board believes that when rural and small-town creators are given equal opportunities, India's digital ecosystem becomes richer, more diverse, and more reliable. As IDMRB prepares to welcome these new members, the initiative marks a major step toward building a transparent, ethical, innovative, and pan-India digital media network.`

    title: "A New Wave of Energy Under Chairman Mukesh Dadhich: A Visionary Leader Redefining India's Digital Media Ecosystem",
    image: "/stories/story7.jpg",

    content: `The Indian Digital Media Regulatory Board (IDMRB) has entered an exciting new era with the appointment of Mukesh Dadhich as its Chairman. Since assuming leadership, Dadhich has infused the organization with renewed energy, purpose, and direction. His arrival marks a significant milestone—not only for the Board, but for the entire digital media community across India.

Mukesh Dadhich is more than just an administrator; he is a storyteller, a reformer, and a visionary who has shaped digital journalism through passion, innovation, and persistence. What makes his journey remarkable is that he hails from Malpura, a small town in Tonk district of Rajasthan, far away from big media hubs. From this modest beginning, Dadhich created a digital news platform that would later become a symbol of grassroots journalism: eNews Bharat.

What started as a small local news portal soon transformed into a powerful digital voice—reaching millions across the state and the country. Under his leadership, eNews Bharat became especially renowned for pioneering WhatsApp journalism, making news accessible to audiences even in rural belts where mainstream portals often do not reach. This innovation helped establish eNews Bharat as a trusted and people-centric platform.

Today, Mukesh Dadhich stands tall in India's digital media ecosystem. Apart from being the Chairman of IDMRB, he also serves as the President of the Malpura News Portal Association, the Chairman of Innovative Media Institute (IMI), and the Founder of eBharat TV OTT Platform—an ambitious project aimed at empowering regional creators and offering local content a national stage.

Dadhich's leadership style is rooted in inclusiveness, integrity, and innovation. His life story itself reflects the promise that digital media holds—anyone with dedication and a voice can shape the narrative, irrespective of geography or background. This belief now forms the foundation of his work at IDMRB. He firmly advocates that digital media should be ethical, transparent, accessible, and future-ready.

Under his stewardship, IDMRB is laying out a strong roadmap for supporting small and rural digital publishers, hyperlocal newsrooms, and emerging OTT creators—especially those working from villages, towns, and underserved regions. He envisions a digital ecosystem where every creator, big or small, has access to knowledge, compliance support, and innovation tools.

Colleagues at IDMRB say that since Mukesh Dadhich stepped in, the organization has gained a fresh momentum. His dynamic approach is helping build an environment of responsibility and collaboration. He aims to empower digital journalists with training, factual reporting standards, AI-verification tools, and transparent grievance mechanisms—ensuring that India's online news space becomes more credible and accountable.

Mukesh Dadhich's story is a strong reminder that leadership does not depend on where one comes from but on what one brings to the table. From a small town in Rajasthan to becoming a national figure in digital media governance, his journey is inspirational for thousands of young journalists and creators across India.

As Chairman, his mission is clear: to make digital media stronger, fairer, and more connected to the public it serves. With his dedication and depth of experience, IDMRB is poised to become a leading force in shaping the future of ethical, innovative, and people-driven digital media in India.`
